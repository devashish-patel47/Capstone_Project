# Capstone_Project

Our project is focused around creating an R interface for the open data portal of City of Windsor which will enable users to load the data into their R environments directly without the need to download each and every file individually. Once that is done, we also aim to perform EDA on select issues and then make a dashboard to show our analysis. 

This repository will contain all the relevant files of our project and the updated files along with the work done so far.

Our approach to this project is 2 staged:

Stage 1: Creation, Development, Deployment of a package named opendatawindsor

This package will directly extract all excel and CSV files from the open data portal of City of Windsor in R. This package will act as an R interface for the users which will enable them to directly load the datasets into their R environment without having the need to download the files on the system.

Stage 2: EDA, analysis and Dashboard Creation

After the data is loaded by using the opendatawindsor package, we will perform EDA on select datasets and create a subsequent dashboard on them using Tableau Desktop.

Note: This repository will be updated at our discretion as we progress with the work in the individual stages.
