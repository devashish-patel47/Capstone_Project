# Capstone_Project

This repository will contain all the relevant files of our project and the updated files along with the work done so far.

Our approach to this project is 2 staged:

Stage 1: Creation, Development, Deployment of a package named opendatawindsor

This package will directly extract all excel and CSV files from the open data portal of City of Windsor in R. This package will act as an R interface for the users which will enable them to directly load the datasets into their R environment without having the need to download the files on the system.

Stage 2: EDA, analysis and Dashboard Creation

After the data is loaded by using the opendatawindsor package, we will perform EDA on select datasets and create a subsequent dashboard on them using Tableau Desktop.

Note: This repository will be updated at our discretion as we progress with the work in the individual stages.
